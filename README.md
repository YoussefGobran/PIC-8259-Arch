## Brief description of the testing strategy:

### 1. PIC_TB_SINGLE_MODE_AEOI_EDGE Testbench:

- Initialize the PICs through ICW1, ICW2, ICW4.
- Setting of the IMR, disabling IR1 through OCW 1.
- IR0-2 is active, and the priority chooses IR0.
- Send the first INTA pulse to set the ISR.
- Read IRR which gives the correct value that IRR0 is disabled and the rest as they are.
- Read the ISR by sending OCW3.
- Send the second pulse during the data bus buffer has the vector address of IR0 to close the interrupt cycle (AEOI).
- Set the IMR, disable IR1.
- Verify that the next interrupt would be of IR2.
- Set automatic rotation, make IR0 active, and send corresponding INTA pulses.
- Verify that, at the end, IR0 becomes the least priority.

### 2. PIC_TB_SINGLE_MODE_EOI_LEVEL Testbench:

- Initialize the PICs through ICW1, ICW2, ICW4.
- Setting of the IR0, making the interrupt flag as on.
- Send two pulses of INTA, but the interrupt flag wouldnâ€™t come down at the end of the second pulse.
- Send non-specific EOI through OCW2 to end the interrupt cycle.
- Set IR0 back to 0 to not restart the cycle because of level triggering.
- Test IR0 again with specific EOI command.
- Disable IR0 before the end because of level triggering.
- Set IR0,1 and send two pulses of INTA pulses.
- Send non-specific rotate EOI to reset IR0.
- Set IR0,1 and send specific rotate on IR1 to reset it.
- IR0 becomes active again because of rotated IR1.

### 3. PIC_TB_CASCADE_MODE_AEOI_EDGE Testbench:

- Use a Master- Slave schema with slaves connected to IR0, IR5.
- Set the three pics with the appropriate ICW1, 2, 3, 4 to all three pics.
- Test IR1-master to ensure normal interrupts are handled correctly.
- Set IR0-slave-0, IR0-slave-5, making IR0,5-master active.
- Verify the correct operation of cascading lines and appropriate IDs of slaves connected to the active IR.
- Finish the cycle for IR0-master, then choose IR5-master.
- Verify the correct vector address at the end of the cycle.
